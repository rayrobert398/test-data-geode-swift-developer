## Spring Data Tests Context Framework for Spring Data GemFire/Geode

This project is a new _Spring Data_ module building on _Spring's_
`TestContext` Framework for writing _Unit_ and _Integration_ Tests
for both _Spring Data_ for [Pivotal GemFire](https://pivotal.io/pivotal-gemfire)
as well as _Spring Data_ for [Apache Geode](http://geode.apache.org/).

This project was born from [_Spring Data GemFire's_](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/)
([GitHub project](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-gemfire))
[test framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-gemfire/tree/2.0.2.RELEASE/src/test/java/org/springframework/data/gemfire/test).
This _test framework_ is used in SDG's test suite to test the proper
function when using either Pivotal GemFire or Apache Geode
in a _Spring_ context.

For many years, users have asked for a way to test their Pivotal GemFire
or Apache Geode-based, _Spring_ applications, whether writing _Unit_
or _Integrations_ tests.  This project is the answer.

This **new** project is still under development.
